# Repository storing my finals documentation

Cloned from [Bachelors Work](https://github.com/Dominik-97/BachelorsWork/tree/Statni_Zkousky) repository, commit 407.

* [Information](Information.md) file contains resources.
* [Statnice](Statnice.md) file contains detailed description of each of the individual questions, it is written in MMD.

## PDF version

For those, that are uncomfortable with a markdown file, you can also use the Statnice.pdf file, which is updated on each commit.
You can find it by goint into Actions and clicking the last run (one generated by GitHub), you can also view the pdf version in the root folder of the repository (one generated by me before every commit).

## HTML version

You can also view the documentation as HTML on the GitHub Pages [here](https://dominik-97.github.io/StanicoveZkousky/index.html).
