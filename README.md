# Repository storing my finals documentation

Cloned from [Bachelors Work](https://github.com/Dominik-97/BachelorsWork/tree/Statni_Zkousky) repository, commit 407.

* [Information](Information.md) file contains resources.
* [Statnice](Statnice.md) file contains detailed description of each of the individual questions, it is written in MMD.

## PDF version

For those, that are uncomfortable with a markdown file, you can also use the [Statnice.pdf](pdfVersion/Statnice.pdf) file, which is updated on each commit.

You can also find it by going into Actions and clicking the last run (one generated by GitHub) in case I forgot to convert the MarkDown into a PDF format.

## HTML version

You can also view the documentation as HTML on the GitHub Pages [here](https://dominik-97.github.io/StanicoveZkousky/dist/index.html).
